# Thesis
Currently building a repo to store my thesis results.

This is not a finished project.  The code is mostly written, but editing and additional analyses are being done in my spare time. I'll gradually add code when time allows to make the documents more digestable and reproducable.

Some sections are a bit disjointed. This is a mix of code that I've created, and some code that I inherited - it's a work in progress.
